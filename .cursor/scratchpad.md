# Background and Motivation

The goal is to build a production-ready Next.js application for booking acupuncture sessions. The app will have two main pieces: a user-facing booking interface and an admin dashboard. All data will be stored in MongoDB. Users can book sessions without authentication, while admins must log in to manage bookings, timeslots, and availability.

- **User App:** Simple, beautiful interface (main color: #FBDAC6) for booking acupuncture sessions by selecting date, time, service, and entering name, telephone, and email.
- **Admin App:** Secure dashboard for managing timeslots, open/close dates, viewing and managing bookings (create, cancel, overview, etc.).

# Initial Data & Content Requirements

## Services (to be selectable in booking form)
- Οξύς και Χρόνιος Πόνος
- Διαχείριση Όρεξης
- Ψυχοσωματικές Διαταραχές
- Δυσπεψία
- Γαστρεντερικές Ενοχλήσεις
- Δερματικές Παθήσεις

## Contact Details (to be displayed on user interface)
- Καλέστε μας: 2310 930 900, 6981 958 248
- Email: info@avgouste.gr

## Address

# Email Notifications

- Integrate a free email service (e.g., SMTP with Gmail, or a free tier of a transactional email provider) to send notifications for new bookings and cancellations.
- Notifications should be sent to both the user and the admin email addresses.
- Design a beautiful, clear email template for these notifications (booking confirmation, cancellation, etc.).

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- Designing a user interface that is both beautiful and simple, using #FBDAC6 as the main color.
- Ensuring robust booking logic to prevent double-booking and handle time slot availability.
- Implementing secure admin authentication and session management.
- Providing a flexible admin interface for managing timeslots and bookings.
- Integrating with MongoDB for all data storage and retrieval.
- Ensuring the app is production-ready (error handling, validation, security, etc.).
- Integrating a free, reliable email service for notifications and designing attractive email templates.

# High-level Task Breakdown

1. **Project Setup**
   - [ ] Initialize Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS (for rapid, beautiful UI development)
   - [ ] Set up MongoDB connection and environment variables
   - [ ] Configure project structure for user and admin pieces

2. **User Booking Interface**
   - [ ] Design and implement the booking form (date, time, service [from provided list], name, telephone, email)
   - [ ] Display available timeslots (fetched from backend)
   - [ ] Validate user input and handle booking submission
   - [ ] Show booking confirmation and error states
   - [ ] Apply main color #FBDAC6 and ensure a beautiful, simple UI
   - [ ] Display contact details and address on the interface (e.g., footer or contact section)

3. **Admin Dashboard**
   - [ ] Implement secure admin authentication (login/logout)
   - [ ] Dashboard overview: list of bookings, stats, etc.
   - [ ] Manage timeslots: create, edit, delete, set open/close dates
   - [ ] Manage bookings: create, cancel, view details
   - [ ] Admin can book on behalf of users

4. **Backend API**
   - [ ] API endpoints for bookings (create, list, cancel)
   - [ ] API endpoints for timeslots (create, list, update, delete)
   - [ ] API endpoints for admin authentication
   - [ ] Input validation and error handling
   - [ ] Integrate free email service for booking/cancellation notifications (with nice templates)

5. **Testing & Production Readiness**
   - [ ] Write unit and integration tests (TDD where possible)
   - [ ] Add error handling, loading states, and user feedback
   - [ ] Security review (admin auth, data validation, etc.)
   - [ ] Prepare for deployment (env vars, build scripts, etc.)

# Project Status Board

- [x] Project Setup (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS initialized)
- [x] MongoDB Setup (driver installed, connection utility created, .env instructions added)
- [x] Project Structure (user and admin entry pages created)
- [ ] User Booking Interface
- [x] Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Backend API
- [ ] Testing & Production Readiness
- [x] Hide past bookings in the admin bookings table
- [x] Show unavailable hours as disabled in the timeslot grids
- [x] Display a table of all date-specific overrides in the admin dashboard

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Project initialized with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS as planned.
- MongoDB driver installed. Connection utility created at `src/lib/mongodb.ts`.
- Please create a `.env.local` file in the `acupuncture-booking` directory with your MongoDB connection string as described in the README:
  ```
  MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
  ```
- Project structure set up: `/user` and `/admin` entry pages created with placeholders. Main color #FBDAC6 is used in the user interface as requested.
- Next step: Begin implementing the User Booking Interface (booking form, service selection, contact info, etc.).

The above admin dashboard improvements have been implemented. Please review the changes:
- Only future bookings are shown in the bookings table.
- Unavailable hours are visually disabled in both global and override timeslot grids.
- All date-specific overrides are listed in a table below the override management section.

Let me know if you want any further adjustments or if you want to mark this milestone as complete.

# Lessons

- Include info useful for debugging in the program output.
- Read the file before you try to edit it.
- If there are vulnerabilities that appear in the terminal, run npm audit before proceeding.
