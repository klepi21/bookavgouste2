# Background and Motivation

The goal is to build a production-ready Next.js application for booking acupuncture sessions. The app will have two main pieces: a user-facing booking interface and an admin dashboard. All data will be stored in MongoDB. Users can book sessions without authentication, while admins must log in to manage bookings, timeslots, and availability.

- **User App:** Simple, beautiful interface (main color: #FBDAC6) for booking acupuncture sessions by selecting date, time, service, and entering name, telephone, and email.
- **Admin App:** Secure dashboard for managing timeslots, open/close dates, viewing and managing bookings (create, cancel, overview, etc.).

# Email Notifications

- Integrate a free email service (e.g., SMTP with Gmail, or a free tier of a transactional email provider) to send notifications for new bookings and cancellations.
- Notifications should be sent to both the user and the admin email addresses.
- Design a beautiful, clear email template for these notifications (booking confirmation, cancellation, etc.).

# Key Challenges and Analysis

- Designing a user interface that is both beautiful and simple, using #FBDAC6 as the main color.
- Ensuring robust booking logic to prevent double-booking and handle time slot availability.
- Implementing secure admin authentication and session management.
- Providing a flexible admin interface for managing timeslots and bookings.
- Integrating with MongoDB for all data storage and retrieval.
- Ensuring the app is production-ready (error handling, validation, security, etc.).
- Integrating a free, reliable email service for notifications and designing attractive email templates.

# Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

- Project initialized with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS as planned.
- MongoDB driver installed. Connection utility created at `src/lib/mongodb.ts`.
- Please create a `.env.local` file in the `acupuncture-booking` directory with your MongoDB connection string as described in the README:
  ```
  MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string_here
  ```
- Project structure set up: `/user` and `/admin` entry pages created with placeholders. Main color #FBDAC6 is used in the user interface as requested.
